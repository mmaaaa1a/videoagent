## ⚡ VideoRAG Framework

<p align="center">
<img src="VideoRAG.png" alt="VideoRAG" />
</p>

VideoRAG introduces a novel dual-channel architecture that synergistically combines graph-driven textual knowledge grounding for modeling cross-video semantic relationships with hierarchical multimodal context encoding to preserve spatiotemporal visual patterns, enabling unbounded-length video understanding through dynamically constructed knowledge graphs that maintain semantic coherence across multi-video contexts while optimizing retrieval efficiency via adaptive multimodal fusion mechanisms.

💻 **Efficient Extreme Long-Context Video Processing**
- Leveraging a Single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU (24G) to comprehend Hundreds of Hours of video content 💪

🗃️ **Structured Video Knowledge Indexing**
- Multi-Modal Knowledge Indexing Framework distills hundreds of hours of video into a concise, structured knowledge graph 🗂️

🔍 **Multi-Modal Retrieval for Comprehensive Responses**
- Multi-Modal Retrieval Paradigm aligns textual semantics and visual content to identify the most relevant video for comprehensive responses 💬

📚 **The New Established LongerVideos Benchmark**
- The new established LongerVideos Benchmark features over 160 Videos totaling 134+ Hours across lectures, documentaries, and entertainment 🎬

## 🚀 Quick Start

VideoRAG is capable of extracting knowledge from multiple videos and answering queries based on those videos. Now, try VideoRAG with your own videos 🤗.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, VideoRAG has only been tested in an English environment. To process videos in multiple languages, it is recommended to modify the  ```WhisperModel``` in [asr.py](https://github.com/HKUDS/VideoRAG/blob/main/videorag/_videoutil/asr.py). For more details, please refer to [faster-whisper](https://github.com/systran/faster-whisper).

**At first**, let the VideoRAG extract and indexing the knowledge from given videos (Only one GPU with 24GB of memory is sufficient, such as the RTX 3090):
```python
import os
import logging
import warnings
import multiprocessing

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
logging.getLogger("httpx").setLevel(logging.WARNING)

# Please enter your openai key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""

from videorag._llm import openai_4o_mini_config
from videorag import VideoRAG, QueryParam


if __name__ == '__main__':
    multiprocessing.set_start_method('spawn')

    # Please enter your video file path in this list; there is no limit on the length.
    # Here is an example; you can use your own videos instead.
    video_paths = [
        'movies/Iron-Man.mp4',
        'movies/Spider-Man.mkv',
    ]
    videorag = VideoRAG(llm=openai_4o_mini_config, working_dir=f"./videorag-workdir")
    videorag.insert_video(video_path_list=video_paths)
```

**Then**, ask any questions about the videos! Here is an exmaple:
```python
import os
import logging
import warnings
import multiprocessing

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
logging.getLogger("httpx").setLevel(logging.WARNING)

# Please enter your openai key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""

from videorag._llm import *
from videorag import VideoRAG, QueryParam


if __name__ == '__main__':
    multiprocessing.set_start_method('spawn')

    query = 'What is the relationship between Iron Man and Spider-Man? How do they meet, and how does Iron Man help Spider-Man?'
    param = QueryParam(mode="videorag")
    # if param.wo_reference = False, VideoRAG will add reference to video clips in the response
    param.wo_reference = True

    videorag = videorag = VideoRAG(llm=openai_4o_mini_config, working_dir=f"./videorag-workdir")
    videorag.load_caption_model(debug=False)
    response = videorag.query(query=query, param=param)
    print(response)
```

## 🧪 Experiments

### LongerVideos
We constructed the LongerVideos benchmark to evaluate the model's performance in comprehending multiple long-context videos and answering open-ended queries. All the videos are open-access videos on YouTube, and we record the URLs of the collections of videos as well as the corresponding queries in the [JSON](https://github.com/HKUDS/VideoRAG/longervideos/dataset.json) file.

| Video Type       | #video list | #video | #query | #avg. queries per list | #overall duration      |
|------------------|------------:|-------:|-------:|-----------------------:|-------------------------|
| **Lecture**      | 12          | 135    | 376    | 31.3                   | ~ 64.3 hours           |
| **Documentary**  | 5           | 12     | 114    | 22.8                   | ~ 28.5 hours           |
| **Entertainment**| 5           | 17     | 112    | 22.4                   | ~ 41.9 hours           |
| **All**          | 22          | 164    | 602    | 27.4                   | ~ 134.6 hours          |

### Process LongerVideos with VideoRAG

Here are the commands you can refer to for preparing the videos used in LongerVideos.

```shell
cd longervideos
python prepare_data.py # create collection folders
sh download.sh # obtain videos
```

Then, you can run the following example command to process and answer queries for LongerVideos with VideoRAG:

```shell
# Please enter your openai_key in line 19 at first
python videorag_longervideos.py --collection 4-rag-lecture --cuda 0
```

### Evaluation

We conduct win-rate comparisons as well as quantitative comparisons with RAG-based baselines and long-context video understanding methods separately. **NaiveRAG, GraphRAG and LightRAG** are implemented using the `nano-graphrag` library, which is consistent with our VideoRAG, ensuring a fair comparison.

In this part, we directly provided the **answers from all the methods** (including VideoRAG) as well as the evaluation codes for experiment reproduction. Please utilize the following commands to download the answers:

```shell
cd reproduce
wget https://archive.org/download/videorag/all_answers.zip
unzip all_answers
```

#### Win-Rate Comparison

We conduct the win-rate comparison with RAG-based baselines. To reproduce the results, please follow these steps:

```shell
cd reproduce/winrate_comparison

# First Step: Upload the batch request to OpenAI (remember to enter your key in the file, same for the following steps).
python batch_winrate_eval_upload.py

# Second Step: Download the results. Please enter the batch ID and then the output file ID in the file. Generally, you need to run this twice: first to obtain the output file ID, and then to download it.
python batch_winrate_eval_download.py

# Third Step: Parsing the results. Please the output file ID in the file.
python batch_winrate_eval_parse.py

# Fourth Step: Calculate the results. Please enter the parsed result file name in the file.
python batch_winrate_eval_calculate.py

```

#### Quantitative Comparison

We conduct a quantitative comparison, which extends the win-rate comparison by assigning a 5-point score to long-context video understanding methods. We use the answers from NaiveRAG as the baseline response for scoring each query. To reproduce the results, please follow these steps:

```shell
cd reproduce/quantitative_comparison

# First Step: Upload the batch request to OpenAI (remember to enter your key in the file, same for the following steps).
python batch_quant_eval_upload.py

# Second Step: Download the results. Please enter the batch ID and then the output file ID in the file. Generally, you need to run this twice: first to obtain the output file ID, and then to download it.
python batch_quant_eval_download.py

# Third Step: Parsing the results. Please the output file ID in the file.
python batch_quant_eval_parse.py

# Fourth Step: Calculate the results. Please enter the parsed result file name in the file.
python batch_quant_eval_calculate.py
```
