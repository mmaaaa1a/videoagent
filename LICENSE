USAGE SCENARIOS AND LICENSE TERMS

Your usage rights depend on how you use this project:

1. FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE ONLY
   If you use only the architectural concepts, designs, and framework 
   structure WITHOUT the current model implementations:
   → MIT License applies

2. CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION AS-IS
   If you use the current codebase with its integrated models:
   
   For Vimo-desktop component:
   → NonCommercial use only (due to ImageBind license)
   
   For VideoRAG-algorithm component:
   → NonCommercial use only (due to ImageBind license)
   
   For the entire project (both Vimo & VideoRAG):
   → NonCommercial use only (due to ImageBind license)

3. MODIFIED IMPLEMENTATION
   If you replace the third-party models with alternatives:
   → License terms depend on the new models you choose
   → Framework architecture remains under MIT License

=======================================================================

COMMERCIAL USE GUIDANCE

FOR COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:
- Option 1: Use only the framework architecture and implement your own 
  models compatible with commercial licenses
- Option 2: Replace ImageBind with commercial-friendly alternatives
- Option 3: Contact ImageBind authors for commercial licensing terms

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION RESTRICTIONS:
Due to ImageBind's NonCommercial license in both Vimo-desktop and 
VideoRAG-algorithm components, the current complete implementation 
is restricted to NonCommercial use only.

=======================================================================

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

1. MODEL REPLACEABILITY: Both Vimo and VideoRAG frameworks are designed 
   to be model-agnostic. Third-party models can be replaced with 
   alternatives that have different license terms.

2. RESPONSIBILITY: You are responsible for understanding and complying 
   with all applicable licenses for your specific usage scenario.

3. CURRENT STATE: This license reflects the current implementation as of 
   the license date. Future versions may integrate different models with 
   different licensing terms.

4. LEGAL ADVICE: This notice is informational only and not legal advice. 
   Consult legal counsel for specific compliance questions.
